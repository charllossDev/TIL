# Let's Echo
Write a bash script which does just one thing: saying "HELLO".

### Input Format

There is no input file required for this problem.

### Output Format

```sh
HELLO
```

# A Quick introduction to 'Echo'

This is the equivalent of common output commands in most programming language (print or puts statements).

For Example:
```shell
echo "Greetings"
```

This outputs just one word "Greetings" (without the quotation marks).
```sh
echo "Greetings $USER, your current working directory is $PWD"
```

This picks up the values of the environment variables  and  and displays something like:

```sh
Greetings prashantb1984, your current working directory is /home/prashantb1984  
```
The above message, of course, will vary from system to system, depending on the setting of environment variables.

```sh
echo HELLO
```
