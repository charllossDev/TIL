## 빅데이터

 기존의 데이터베이스 관리도구의 능력을 넘어서는 대량의 정형 또는 비정형 데이터의 집합 데이터로부터 가치를 추출하고 결과를 분석하는 기술

 기술 : 컴퓨터 1대로 처리하지 못하므로, 여러대를 연결해서 데이터를 저장하고 처리해야 하는 기술

빅테이터 기술은 대부분 하둡이라고 생각할 수 있다.

데이터를 읽어와서 변환하고, 핵심을 추출하는 것도 마찬가지로 컴퓨터 1대로 할 수 있는것보다 속도가 빨라야 한다.

맵리듀스 = 분산 데이터 처리 -> 현재는 스파크가 가장 많이 사용되고 있다.

## 왜 데이터 분석을 하는가?

* 비싼 비용에도 불구하고 큰 양의 데이터를 분석하는 이유? : 사업에 큰 영향력
  * 광고 비즈니스, 커머스, 금융 분야에서는 데이터가 매출과 직결되기 때문에 비싼 비용에도 데이터 분석에 큰 공을 들인다.

## BIG Data

Big data is a term used to refer to data sets that are too large or complex for traditional data-processing application software to adequately deal with. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] Other concepts later attributed with big data are veracity (i.e., how much noise is in the data) [4] and value.[5]

Current usage of the term "big data" tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem."[6] Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on."[7] Scientists, business executives, practitioners of medicine, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet search, fintech, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[8] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research.[9]

Data sets grow rapidly- in part because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information- sensing Internet of things devices such as mobile devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[10][11] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[12] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×1018) of data are generated.[13] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume will grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020.[14] By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[15] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[16]

Relational database management systems, desktop statistics[clarification needed] and software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty handling big data. The work may require "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers".[17] What qualifies as being "big data" varies depending on the capabilities of the users and their tools, and expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. "For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration."[18]
